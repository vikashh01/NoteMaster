# Notes Makers Web Application

## 1. Introduction
The Notes Makers web application is designed to allow users to create, edit, delete, and manage notes efficiently. This test plan outlines the testing strategy to ensure the application's functionality, usability, performance, and security.

## 2. Objectives
- Verify that users can create, edit, delete, and search for notes.
- Ensure the application maintains data integrity and security.
- Validate the responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Identify and fix any functional and UI issues.
- Ensure smooth user experience without critical bugs.

## 3. Scope
### In Scope:
- User authentication (Signup, Login, Logout)
- Notes creation, editing, deletion, and search
- UI/UX consistency across different devices
- Error handling and validation messages
- Data persistence and retrieval

### Out of Scope:
- Performance/load testing
- Security penetration testing beyond basic validations

## 4. Testable Features
- **User Authentication**: Signup, login, logout
- **Notes Management**: Creating, updating, deleting, and searching for notes
- **User Interface**: Responsive design, UI consistency
- **Error Handling**: Form validation, empty note handling, invalid input scenarios
- **Performance**: Page load time and responsiveness

## 5. Testing Approach
### Manual Testing:
- Functional testing to verify core features.
- UI testing to ensure a consistent experience.
- Negative testing for handling invalid inputs.

### Automation Testing:
- Automate test cases using **Selenium with Java and TestNG**.
- Implement explicit waits for smooth execution.
- Execute **smoke, sanity, and regression** tests.
- Run automation scripts on different browsers using **TestNG parallel execution**.

### Compatibility Testing:
- Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Mobile responsiveness testing on Android and iOS devices.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Test Manager**: Oversees the entire testing process and ensures timely execution.
- **QA Engineers**: Write test cases, execute tests, report bugs, and verify fixes.
- **Developers**: Fix bugs reported during testing.
- **Project Manager**: Ensures alignment with business goals and timelines.

## 11. Risks and Mitigation Plans

| Risk | Mitigation Plan |
|------|----------------|
| Unclear requirements leading to scope creep | Regular meetings with stakeholders to clarify scope |
| Browser compatibility issues | Test on multiple browsers and screen sizes |
| Delayed bug fixes affecting test execution | Prioritize bugs based on severity and impact |
| Lack of test data for edge cases | Create a robust test data strategy |
